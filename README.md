An agent skill — for Claude Code, Codex, and any `SKILL.md`-compatible agent — that
builds an immersive, **scroll-scrubbed "fly through the world" landing page** for any industry or brand — the kind where, as you scroll, a camera flies
from *outside* each scene *into* its interior, then flows on to the next scene with **no
cuts**. One continuous connected flight through a little generated world (think the Emons
logistics site, applied to whatever you want).

## Install

### Claude Code — as a plugin (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add oso95/scroll-world
/plugin install scroll-world@scroll-world
```

Then just ask for a scroll-through world landing page, or invoke `/scroll-world`.

### Codex & other agents — via the skills CLI

Using [Vercel's skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills), which installs into
Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and 20+ other agents:

```bash
npx skills add oso95/scroll-world            # pick your agent(s) when prompted
npx skills add oso95/scroll-world -a codex   # or target Codex directly
```

In Codex, invoke it with `$scroll-world` (or `/skills` to browse), or just ask for a
scroll-through world landing page.

### Manually (drop-in skill)

Copy the skill folder into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oso95/scroll-world
cp -R scroll-world/skills/scroll-world ~/.claude/skills/   # Claude Code
cp -R scroll-world/skills/scroll-world ~/.codex/skills/    # Codex
```

## Requirements

- Codex with its built-in `image_gen` tool for the default still-image workflow.
- A [Kie.ai](https://kie.ai) API key in the project's ignored `.env.local`, plus enough
  credits for `bytedance/seedance-2-fast` video generations.
- `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` for frame extraction and encoding.
- Python 3 (the Kie client uses only the standard library). Pillow is optional for
  background knockout work.
- Optional fallback: the [Higgsfield CLI](https://higgsfield.ai), authenticated with
  credits.

### Provider matrix

| Role | Default | Fallback | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scene stills | Codex built-in `image_gen` | Higgsfield `gpt_image_2` | Copy approved stills into the project workspace and inspect every image. |
| Video dives + connectors | Kie.ai `bytedance/seedance-2-fast` | Higgsfield frame-locking models | Kie runs at 720p and supports both `--start-image` and `--end-image`. |
| Pipeline guide | `references/pipeline-kie.md` | `references/pipeline.md` | Do not mix video providers inside one chain. |

## What it does

By default it uses Codex's built-in `image_gen` for cohesive isometric diorama stills and
[Kie.ai](https://kie.ai) `bytedance/seedance-2-fast` for the camera flights. Higgsfield
remains a complete fallback. Only video workflows that can frame-lock both ends of a seam
are supported. The resulting clips are scrubbed
by scroll position — the same technique behind Apple's scroll-through product pages. The
camera genuinely moves; scroll only drives time. It's **framework-agnostic**: you get the
provider pipelines, the prompt templates, and a portable vanilla-JS scrub engine that
drops into plain HTML, Next.js, Vue, or a Python-served page — nothing assumes a stack.

When invoked, the skill:

1. **Interviews you** — the subject/industry + pitch, a brand kit (import from a URL, hand
   it over, or have it proposed), art direction, the ordered scenes the camera visits,
   whether you want the **mobile version** (a second chain rendered natively in 9:16
   portrait — composed for phones, not a crop of the landscape film), and the **budget** —
   render tiers and stills source shown with estimated credit costs, approved before
   anything generates.
2. **Generates the assets** — one still per scene, one "dive-in" camera
   clip per scene, and the **connector** clips that join consecutive scenes, generated
   from the actual rendered frames of their neighbours so every seam is frame-identical.
   Mobile opt-in renders a parallel portrait chain the same way, frame-locked against its
   own 9:16 renders.
3. **Wires it up** — a config-driven scroll engine that plays the whole chain as one
   flight, serving the portrait clips and posters automatically on phones.

## Notes

- Video generation costs provider credits (~2N-1 video generations for N scenes; the
  native mobile chain doubles them) and takes a while, so the skill obtains budget
  approval, runs generations detached, and preserves resumable Kie manifests. Codex
  stills use the user's Codex allowance; the Higgsfield fallback has its own credit cost.
- The generated `.mp4`/`.webp` assets are produced per project; they're not shipped here.
